Your Week Ahead: When does a good idea become a bad idea? When it isn't properly thought through. When the impetus for acting on it becomes so compelling that the possible consequences are overlooked. Or when the drawbacks are given so much attention that they lead to a series of complex contingency plans that cost so much or take such effort, they negate all the potential advantages. You have got a good idea now. A very good idea. This week, you just need to be wise enough to take a balanced view of the implications. 
Now, I've just recorded a special free video telling you all about Venus going 'stationary' and how it will bring more love and opportunity into your life.You can watch it right now and listen to your new Venus week ahead forecasts, here!
